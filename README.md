# AHKScripts
A collection of AutoHotkey scripts.
Scripts are made to work with AutoHotkey version 1.1, downloadable here: https://www.autohotkey.com/, unless otherwise specified.
For most functionality, the master.ahk file and ahkScripts folder must be placed into the windows startup folder, found here:  
**"C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"**

Each Script has further instructions listed at the top of the code.
